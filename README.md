SDBlog
======


Demo of Blog based on GoogleAppEngine and python including topics like cache,db,json file,cookie,etc.

All modules are put into main.py,and all html files are in template.

ps:

I really recommend GAE, which is so awesome and convenient.

If you met disturbing troubles on setting up Apache or any other development enviorment(Smarty,Thinkphp,etc.), you would really enjoy hacking based on GAE.

Really, no troubles, no wired errors, no disgusting path settings, just download GAE and install it. Done! and enjoy hacking!
